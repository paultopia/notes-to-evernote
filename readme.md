This is a helper command-line utility designed to facilitate getting notes from Apple notes into Evernote.

It depends on a wonderful little tool by a chap named Pedro Matiello which takes all your Apple notes and dumps them into html files in a directory--- and it appears to still work in El Capitan (at least on notes without any of the new formatting.  Haven't tried on new formatting notes.)  That tool: https://github.com/pmatiello/notes-export

This tool gathers up all the html files that Matiello's tool creates and stick them somewhere more useful, namely into an Evernote folder.  (Google Keep would be nicer, but it doesn't appear that Google Keep has an api.  I wrote this to migrate away from using Apple notes because of sync problems/slowness after upgrading to El Capitan/iOS9.  Evernote, however, also has sync problems.  So I guess you choose which you'd rather deal with more.  Or help nag Google to make it possible to programmatically interact with Keep: https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=3477 )

You need an Evernote account (obviously), and you need to get a developer token.  The dev token can be acquired from Evernote: https://dev.evernote.com/#apikey

**USAGE**

1. First, use Matiello's tool to put all your notes in a clean new directory.

2. then call this tool from the command line, as follows:

python n2ev.py DEVTOKEN FULLPATHTODIR NOTEBOOKNAME

(probably easiest to wrap the arguments in quotes)

DEVTOKEN is the developer token for your Evernote account

FULLPATHTODIR is, obviously, the path to the directory in which your notes are stored, as html files.  Nothing else should be in it.  Usefully, in el capitan, if you right-click/secondary-click on the folder name in finder, then hold the option key, you will get an option to copy the full path name.  

NOTEBOOKNAME is the new evernote notebook to be created.  If you give it an existing notebook, it'll throw an error, so don't do that.  (n.b. it would be pretty easy to wrap that in a try/except block to just allow this tool to save to an existing notebook if the one you pass it is found, but I can't be bothered.  makes more sense to just make a new notebook for it anyway.)

**Requires**

evernote amd beautifulsoup4 modules, both of which can be installed from pip.

**DISCLAIMER**

I'm not responsible if you delete your shit using this.  Only run it if you know what you're doing.  I've tested it successfully on a couple of trivial files and the Evernote sandbox server, but haven't run it on my own thousands-of-notes note collection yet.  I believe it will work...
